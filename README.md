# Flight Comparator with Kiwi API

It doesn't really work in the sense that Google Flights and Skyscanners seem to be able to give me a cheaper price than Kiwi API but nevertheless it was a good learning experience.
I didn't really optimize it for usage (e.g. no GUI, variables are all over the place, you have to insert the dates yourself etc.) because I think using Skyscanner/Google Flights will yield cheaper flights. Maybe one day I will use Selenium to make a web-scraping version.

Maybe.
